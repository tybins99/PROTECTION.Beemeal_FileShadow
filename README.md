## __Project description__
Permits to obfuscate a file so that you can attach it to a mail even if it is an EXE, DLL, 
or whatever could be blocked by a mail security scanner.
This is useful for malware analsysts that need to share samples, and are constantly annoyed
by mail antivirus or security scanners.

## __Cryptographic security level__
The security level of the protected file is quite low, because the aim is not to 
obtain confidentiality, but just to deceive antivirus & security scanners.

## __Compile environment__
Tested on Visual studio 2017 (both release & Debug)
